# Fast Chemail

> A Dart library to validate the email as it is defined in the
> [HTML specification](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/forms.html#valid-e-mail-address).
> The RFC 5322 is too lax (allowing comments, whitespace characters, and quoted
> strings in manners unfamiliar to most users) to be of practical use.

Also, has been considered the bounds defined in:

- [SMTP :: Size Limits and Minimums](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5321#section-4.5.3.1)

    > - The maximum total length of a user name or other local-part is 64 octets.
    > - The maximum total length of a domain name or number is 255 octets.
    > - The maximum total length of a reverse-path or forward-path is 256 octets
    >   (including the punctuation and element separators).

    There is a great contradiction. The maximum total length of an email address
    is 320 octects:

    `{64}@{255} => 64 + 1 + 255 = 320`

    but the maximum total length of a reverse-path or forward-path is 256 octets.
    Addition, that is only the length of the email address because it may
    contain a display name, like `first last <local@domain>` and will often
    extend 320 octets.

    Now well, since the standard says: "*to the maximum extent possible,
    implementation techniques that impose no limits on the length of these
    objects should be used*", the bound to reverse-path or forward-path will not
    be taken.

- [Application Techniques for Checking and Transformation of Names](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3696#section-3)

    Such memo is not a standard else informational, so the correction done in
    the [errata](https://www.rfc-editor.org/errata_search.php?rfc=3696&eid=1690)
    is not followed.
